# Qualitative Interviews – rAiSE Project

This repository contains documents and data used in the qualitative evaluation of the **rAiSE (Repository Analysis in Software Engineering)** tool. rAiSE was developed to support data mining, visualization, and analysis from platforms like GitHub and Jira.

## 📄 Files

### 1. `InterviewRAISE.pdf`
This document contains the **interview questions** used during the qualitative study. The questions guide participants through practical tasks using the rAiSE interface, including:

- Querying pull requests and issues
- Exploring available repositories
- Analyzing productivity
- Retrieving data from specific time periods
- Exporting mined information

> ⚠️ All questions are written in **Portuguese**, as the participants are native Portuguese speakers.

### 2. `Post-experiment Survey - RAISE.pdf`
This file contains the **post-experiment questionnaire**, designed using the **Technology Acceptance Model (TAM)**. It evaluates:

- Perceived ease of use
- Perceived usefulness
- Intention to use the tool in the future
- User experience with different screens (Overview, Preview, Collect, Jobs)
- Participant background and experience

> ⚠️ The entire form is also in **Portuguese**.

### 3. Transcribed and Anonymized Interviews (`Exp_P1.txt` to `Exp_P6.txt`)
The repository includes **spoken interviews** with six participants (P1 to P6) who used the rAiSE tool to perform the tasks described in the interview document.

After each session, the audio recordings were **automatically transcribed using a Large Language Model (LLM)** and then **anonymized** to protect personal data.

Each transcript file:

- Captures the participant’s natural reasoning, mistakes, corrections, and spontaneous feedback
- Enables **future qualitative analysis**, especially regarding usability
- Helps identify **where each participant succeeded or failed** in the tasks

> ✅ A reference **answer key** for the tasks is available in the article, in the form of a table. Researchers can compare the participant responses with this answer key for evaluation purposes.

## 📌 Notes
These materials support the analysis of the rAiSE tool’s usability, usefulness, and acceptance. By combining task-based interviews, structured TAM feedback, and anonymized transcripts, this dataset allows for a comprehensive understanding of the user experience.
