# Qualitative Interviews – rAiSE Project

This repository contains two documents used in the qualitative evaluation of the **rAiSE (Repository Analysis in Software Engineering)** tool. rAiSE was developed to support data mining, visualization, and analysis from platforms like GitHub and Jira.

## 📄 Files

### 1. `InterviewRAISE.pdf`
This document contains the **interview questions** used during the qualitative study. The questions guide participants through practical tasks with the rAiSE interface, including:

- Querying pull requests and issues
- Exploring available repositories
- Analyzing productivity
- Retrieving data from specific time periods
- Exporting mined information

> ⚠️ All questions are written in **Portuguese**, as the participants were native Portuguese speakers.

### 2. `Post-experiment Survey - RAISE.pdf`
This document includes the **post-experiment questionnaire**, designed using the **Technology Acceptance Model (TAM)**. It evaluates:

- Perceived ease of use
- Perceived usefulness
- Intention to use the tool in the future
- User experience across different screens (Overview, Preview, Collect, Jobs)
- Participant background and experience

> ⚠️ The entire form is also in **Portuguese**.

## 📌 Notes
These materials were used to assess the usability and acceptance of the rAiSE tool. Combining task-based interviews with structured feedback enabled a deeper understanding of the tool’s strengths and usability challenges.
